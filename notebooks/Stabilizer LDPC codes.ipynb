    "Classical LDPC codes are just codes that admit a sparse parity check matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say \"admit\" because a code can have many equivalent parity check matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the stabilzer language (the stabilizer formalism) this would mean that there is a representation in which, each stabilizer acts non trivially on a small set of physical qubits (we say the stabilizer has low weight), and each qubit is acted on by a small number of stabilizers."
