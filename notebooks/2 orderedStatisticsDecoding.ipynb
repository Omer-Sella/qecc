    "Choose a generator matrix $G$, meaning a matrix which row space spans the code, and a parity matrix $H$, namely a matrix which kernel is the code.\n",
    "By definition of the parity matrix, if $c\\in \\mathcal{C}$ then $H \\cdot c = \\vec{0}$. Generally we call the resulting vector $H \\cdot w = s$ the syndrome. \n",

    "1.  Show that for an information set $I$, the map: $P_I: \\mathcal{C} \\rightarrow F_2^k$ defined by: $P_I(c) = P_I(c_{i\\in [n]}) = c_{i\\in I}$ is linear, one to one and onto, i.e., it is an isomorphism of vector spaces.\n",

    "Every pair of information set and syndrome for the code $\\mathcal{C}$ and $H$ gives us an encoding $E(x) = E(s,I,x):F_2^k \\rightarrow F^n_2$: first, the bijection $P_I$ picks one representative of $\\mathcal{C}$ - the one that agrees with x over all indices in $I$. Then the rest of the values for indices outside $I$ are uniqely determined by the syndrome.\n",

    "If we knoew of an information set $I$ such that $e_I = \\hat{e}_I$, i.e., they agree on the set $I$, then the encoding $E(s = H\\cdot e,I,\\hat{e})$ would find us the right $e$.\n",

    "$$p_i = P(e_i = 1)$$\n",
    "And we decide that we estimate $\\hat{e}$ using: $e_i = 1$ if $p_i >= 1/2$ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we introduce the notion of a reliability $\\rho$ of an index $i$:\n",
    "$$\\rho_i = P(\\hat{e}_i = e_i)$$\n",
    "Which using our estimation rule means \n",
    "$$\\rho_i = max(p_i, 1-p_i)$$\n",
    "(since if $p_i$ is the bigger one, we decided $\\hat{e_i}$ = 1, and otherwise, i.e. $1-p_i$  is bigger, and we decided $\\hat{e_i}=0$ but either way we are as certain as $max(p_i, 1-p_i)$). \n",
