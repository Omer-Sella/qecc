    Given the stabilizer generators of a CSS code, compute its logical operators.

    Input:
        stabilizerGeneratorsX (np.ndarray): The X stabilizer generators - not assumed to be in reduced form.
        stabilizerGeneratorsZ (np.ndarray): The Z stabilizer generators - not assumed to be in reduced form.
    Output:
        logicalOperatorsX (np.ndarray): The X logical operators - in reduced form, but could contain a component from stabilizerGeneratorsX.
        logicalOperatorsZ (np.ndarray): The Z logical operators - in reduced form, but could contain a component from stabilizerGeneratorsZ.
    
    We first reduce all input matrices to their row echelon form.

    For a CSS code with parity-check matrices $H_X$ and $H_Z$ (over $F_2$), corresponding to stabilizerGeneratorsX and stabilizerGeneratorsZ we first find logical $Z$ operators. 

    The $Z$ logical operators are those $Z$ operators that commute with all $X$ stabilizers (i.e., they are in the normalizer of S), but are not in the span of the $Z$ stabilizers, i.e. in S.
    
    We first look for all $Z$ operators that commute with all $X$ stabilizers by solving the equation $H_X z = 0$ over $F_2$ and obtaining a set of basis vectors for this space.
    
    Some of them are $Z$-stabilizers, some are logical $Z$ operators. (X stabilizers, X operators)
    
    To check if a logical $Z$ operator, v, is in the span of the matrix $H_Z$ == stabilizerGeneratorsZ, 
    we test whether the rank of stabilizerGeneratorsZ is strictly smaller than that of np.vstack((stabilizerGeneratorsX, v)). 
    If yes, it means that v is in the row space of stabilizerGeneratorsX.
    Any v that survived this test is a logical $Z$ operator.
