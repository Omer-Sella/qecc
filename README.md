# Quantum Low Density Parity Check codes

What's in here ?

Resources (explanations, code, jupyter notebooks) to help you get started with quantum LDPC codes.

# Who is this for ?

This repository is intended for myself before I leanred quantum ECC. Hopefully, it would allow the reader who knows some classical ECC and some linear algebra to understand how to carry their knowledge from classical ECC to quantum ECC, which is what I needed a few years ago.

I found that most books that teach Quantum computing delay quantum ECC to very end, even though (I think) they could be learned and used before most of the quantum computing background.

Another thing I found is that some (very good) books rely on the reader knowing stabilizer formalism and what it means to measure a stabilizer in order to understand and use ECC which could be regarder over the binary field.
